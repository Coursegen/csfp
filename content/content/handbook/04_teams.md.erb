Each semester, depending on how many projects there are, and what they are, are and how many qualified students there are, there will be between 4 and 6 students per project. I will take your input on preferences but in the end you will be assigned to a project. This will happen before the semester even starts.

You will learn a lot about working on a team. The success of the overall project will depend in great part on how well you work together. It is a good idea to figure out someone on the team who will be the team lead. The team lead isn’t the dictator, but the team members should listen to her or him when it comes to communications, commitments, cooperation and so on. It’s important that the whole team work together to keep each other on track and in contact.

#### Team expectations
* Each team will select from the team members who will be the team lead. This selection needs to happen early on but could change if the team wants to.
