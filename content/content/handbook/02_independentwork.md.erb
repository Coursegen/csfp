desc: What does it take to be successful, as an individual and as a team

This is a truly “independent” project. For those of you who are familiar with the way startups work, you can think of me as your Board of Directors (“BOD”).  BODs don’t do any work, planning, communicating, coding or anything. They just oversee the company and try to make sure that it stays out of trouble. In a startup, a BOD meets maybe once every three months.

I will meet with each team once a week. Before each meeting, the teams are expected to write a bulleted list email with a summary of accomplishments, plan for next week and any obstacles. At the meeting this update will also be shared verbally.

#### Standard Documents
The team, the professor, and the partner all will be collaborating with each other. To facilitate this, the team is expected to set up a github repository where everything related to the project gets stored. This includes code, documents, images and so on. This should be a public directory. It should contain:

* A team info text file where each team member's name, email and cell phone number is noted. Cell phone is only used in "emergencies" when I have to text someone for one reason or another.
* A folder with the weekly status update (see below.)

#### Required Weekly Deliverables
Every week the team will write and the team lead will email to me a status update. The status report should have at least:

* What was accomplished by every team member during the week
* How many hours total the student spent on those accomplishments
*
