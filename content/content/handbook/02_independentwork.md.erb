This is a truly “independent” project. For those of you who are familiar with the way startups work, you can think of me as your Board of Directors (“BOD”).  BODs don’t do any work, planning, communicating, coding or anything. They just oversee the company and try to make sure that it stays out of trouble. In a startup, a BOD meets maybe once every three months.

I will meet with each team once a week. Before each meeting, the teams are expected to write a bulleted list email with a summary of accomplishments, plan for next week and any obstacles. At the meeting this update will also be shared verbally.
