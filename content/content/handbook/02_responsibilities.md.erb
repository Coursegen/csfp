title: Responsibilities
desc: What does it take to be successful in this program, as an individual and as a team
---
This is a truly “independent” project. For those of you who are familiar with the way startups work, you can think of the Professor (Pito) as your Board of Directors (“BOD”).  BODs don’t do any work, planning, communicating, coding or anything. They just oversee the company and try to make sure that it stays out of trouble. In a startup, a BOD meets maybe once every three months.

#### Weekly Meeting

The Professor will meet with all students (of all teams) once a week. The required status report (see below) should be prepared and emailed to all students BEFORE that meeting.

At the very start of the semester we will find an hour time slot that is doable for the majority of the students based on their schedules.

#### Standard Documents

The team, the professor, and the partner all will be collaborating with each other. To facilitate this, the team is expected to set up a github repository where everything related to the project gets stored. This includes code, documents, images and so on. This should be a public directory. It should contain:

* A team info text file where each team member's name, email and cell phone number is noted. Cell phone is only used in "emergencies" when I have to text someone for one reason or another.
* A folder with the weekly status update (see below.)

#### Required Weekly Deliverables
Every week the team will write a team status report, stored in the right place in the git repo. The team lead will email me the contents of the report.

* What was accomplished by every team member during the week
* How many hours total the student spent on those accomplishments

#### Workload

Like any Brandeis course, there is a serious expectation that to be successful each student needs invest *an average of 12 hours per week* in work on the course.

To the partner, as an example, 4 students @ 12 hours is a full person week. They have high expectations. I hope they come away impressed.

This course has no homework and no exams. Therefore it is totally up to you to generate momentum, set and commit to goals to each other, set milestones, meeting times and schedules.

#### Reading

Here is the reading list for this program:
