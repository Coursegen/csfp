Like any Brandeis course, there is a serious expectation that to be successful each student needs invest an average of 12 hours per week in work on the course. To the partner, as an example, 4 students @ 12 hours is a full person week. They have high expectations. I hope they come away impressed.

This course has no homework and no exams. Therefore it is totally up to you to generate momentum, set and commit to goals to each other, set milestones, meeting times and schedules.
