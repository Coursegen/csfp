#### Welcome
Congratulations and welcome to the Cosi Field Project. This Handbook is aimed at students who are in this program who want to know how it works, how to excel in it, what the expectations are, deliverables, grading and everything else.

In addition, I expect that prospective students and partners will both peruse it.

This program is kind of different and will require you to bring your “A” game to be successful. In this handbook I will try to give you a bit of a roadmap about how to get off to a great start.
