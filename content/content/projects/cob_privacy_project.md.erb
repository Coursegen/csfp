title: City of Boston - Transparency Project
---
#### High level objective
* The City of Boston (CoB) wants to explore the public's attitude towards various  Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensing that is or may be deployed. 
* We would like to allow interested members of the public receive real time notificaitons when they are in range of one of these sensors which may be measuring, sensing, photographing, recording or counting them.
* The purpose of this exercise is to generate more general awareness and transparency about the use of IoT and the data use, privacy, and security concerns that technology in the public realm may raise among users

#### Types of Sensors
* Cameras
* Pedestrian Counters
* Air Quality Sensors
* Motion activated lights and sensors

#### Possible Approach
* A simple android/iOS app which can send notifications when users are entering a designated IoT zone
* A back end database with a nice user interface to allow information to be entered about the location, schedule, and other information about the Sensors. This user interface would be restricted to appropriate CoB personnel.
* A nice public web site for understanding what kind of sensors exist and the neighborhoods/ city projects with which they are associated.
* The web site would include a nice user interface (with a map) allowing the public to explore the location, schedule and other information of interest.

#### Open Questions
* Other than GPS location are there other ways to detect that a notification is needed
* Can these notifications be auto-generated or do they need to rely on manually-entered information about where the sensors are?

#### Meeting schedule
* Game out the various use cases when notifications might be a good solution for this, in addition to creating some we could pilot on new projects.
