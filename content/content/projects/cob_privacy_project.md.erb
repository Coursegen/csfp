---
#### High level objective
* The City of Boston (CoB) wants to explore the public's attitude towards various  Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensing that is or may be deployed. 
* The objective is to allow interested members of the public receive real time notificaitons when they are in range of one of these sensors which may be measuring, sensing, photographed,recorded or being counted. 
* The purpose of this exercise would be to generate more transparency about data use, privacy, and technology in the public realm among users

#### Types of Sensors
* Cameras
* ...

#### Possible Approach
* A simple android/iOS app which can send notifications
* A back end database with a nice user interface to allow  information to be entered about the location, schedule, and other information about the Sensors
* A nice public web site

#### Open Questions
* Other than GPS location are there other ways to detect that a notification is needed

#### Meeting schedule
* Game out the various use cases when notifications might be a good solution for this, in addition to creating some we could pilot on new projects.
